## About
It used to be my cpeg657 course project.

But now... it is my toy project :soccer:

I will provide more description when I think it is ready to be published.

## Library Dependencies

1. [ncurses](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses)
2. [readline](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline) 
3. curl 
4. lex (libl) and yacc

An Ubuntu user may install all the dependencies by the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install flex bison libncurses5-dev readline-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
