\$$ to €, this means that 
1€ = 0.86205 £
  =1€ = 0.86205 £  \\ \Leftrightarrow & \frac{1.3186}{0.86205}\
= 1£ \end{align} Now you know, that 1£ is equivalent to 
 to €, this means that $1€ = 1.3186\
1 € = 1.3186  \$$ and 
. Hence 
 = \frac{1}{1.3186} € = \frac{1}{1.3186} (0.86205) £ \approx 0.6538 £
100 £ \approx \frac{100}{0.6538} \
