x>0
n^m=e^{n\ln m}=\sum^\infty_{k=0}\dfrac{n^k(\ln m)^k}{k!}\text{, which you can approximate. For any real number $x>0$, we have }\\ n^m=\sum^\infty_{k=0}\dfrac{(2n)^k}{k!}\left(\sum^\infty_{j=0}\dfrac{1}{2j+1}\left(\dfrac{m-1}{m+1}\right)^{2j+1}\right)^k\text{, which you can approximate.}\\ \text{There are many more, but this is the one that came to my mind first.}
