 at the end of 
 years, Steve wishes to make regular monthly payments that will amount to the same total after 
 years. Determine the monthly payment if interest is compounded monthly at an annual rate of

 only. Mathematically one can establish an equivalence between the investments (at the end of 
 years and at the end of 
 years) and a series of 
m=12
r=4\%=0.04
i=\frac{r}{m}=\frac{4}{12}\%=\frac{0.04}{12}
