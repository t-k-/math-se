 Theorem 1: Let $f:R^n \rightarrow R^p$ be continuously differentiable in an open set containing $a$, where $p\le n$. If $f(a)=0$ and the $p\times n$ matrix $(D_jf^i(a))$ has rank $p$, then there is an open set $A\subset R^n$ containing $a$ and a differentiable function $h:A\rightarrow R^n$ with differentiable inverse such that
