X - 17\% = \$20,000.00
X

. If 
 is 100% of what you need to charge, then you have: $$\begin{array}{rcl} X &\longrightarrow &100\%\\\ 20,000 &\longrightarrow&83\% \end{array}$$ By the Rule of Three, to get the value of 
 you multiply across the known diagonal and divide by the remaining quantity; so 
24,096.39
\begin{array}{rcl} X &\longrightarrow &100\%\\\ 20,000 &\longrightarrow&83\% \end{array}
