1 and each prize is 
\frac{10^{(4)}}{10^4}
\
, so there must be more than 
 winning tickets. This is the case if and only if all four digits of the winning number are distinct, in which case there are 
 winning tickets. (If the winning number has three distinct digits, there are only 
10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7
4
\frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7}{10^4}=\frac{10^{\underline 4}}{10^4}\;.
0.496\cdot4000-0.504\cdot2000=976
