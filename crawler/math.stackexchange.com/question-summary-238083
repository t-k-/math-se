P(\text{both aces}| \text{first card is ace})
P(\text{both aces} | \text{first card is ace}) = \dfrac{P(\text{both aces} \cap \text{first card is ace})}{P(\text{first card is ace})} = \dfrac{P(\text{both aces})}{P(\text{first card is ace})} = \dfrac{\binom{4}{2}/\binom{52}{2}}{1-\binom{48}{2}/\binom{52}{2}} = \dfrac{1}{33}
\dfrac{1}{17}
\frac{\text{#ways to choose 1 ace}}{\text{#ways to choose any 1 card}} = 4/52
\mathbb{P}[\text{both aces}|\text{first card is an ace}] = \frac{\frac{4 \cdot 3}{52 \cdot 51}}{4/52} = 3/51 = 1/17
\frac 1{33}
P(\text{both aces} | \text{first card is ace}) =\frac 1{17}
P(\text{both aces} | \text{first card is ace}) = \dfrac{P(\text{both aces} \cap \text{first card is ace})}{P(\text{first card is ace})} = \dfrac{P(\text{both aces})}{P(\text{first card is ace})}?
