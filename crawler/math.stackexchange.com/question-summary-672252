\
 on the next keystroke being an A fairly (so that if the keystroke is indeed an A, then the payoff is 
26
\
) on the next letter being B, and so on. If the gambler ever loses a wager, then it leaves. Now letâ€™s analyze what happens when ABRACADABRA is finally spelled out. The gambler who kept making correct wagers all the way through won 
 26^{11}
\
, and a third gambler who got in on the final A got 
26
\
26^4+\
. But all the wagers are fair, and the house gets 
1
26^{11}+26^4+26
\
 on the NEXT USEFUL LETTER, why the game is not fair anymore? In this case, if the last letters are "..ABRACA" the new gambler bets on D instead of A. In this way the total payoff at the end of the game will be 
26^{11}+\
26^2 + \
\
26
\
 or 
26^{10}
