2^n
2 round you should offer to split the money with both dollars to you and nothing to your brother. He then has a choice between letting both dollars go to you, or letting both dollars go to charity, and we're assuming he will prefer you having them, so you end up with \
4 round you know that if you offer less than \
2, your brother will end up with \
2 rather than them going to charity. So you should offer \
8 round, it is the same! If you offer less than \
2 your brother can either take the \
4 round, where he will take home \
2 your offer will be accepted and you take home \
16 round, don't offer less than \
6 that will be accepted. So that's what you do, and you take home \
32 round you offer \
2 round you should offer \
4 round, offer one more than the \
2. You get \
8 round, offer \
16 round, offer \
32 round, offer \
64 round, offer \
