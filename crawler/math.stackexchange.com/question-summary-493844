40,000 plus interest charges may be fully paid off in the 9th month when \
40,000 is equivalent to

2061.06 \times 1.01^{11}+\

5000. So it will have to be paid off in 21st month with payment of 
884.63
4,115.37 and future monthly payments for Saks Fifth Avenue (SFA) card. Since initial balance is \
5000 are needed. Check if card can be paid off fully in the 25th month. Payment required in 25th month =
