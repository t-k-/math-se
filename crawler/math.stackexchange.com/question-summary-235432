P(\text{3 hearts})=P(\text{heart on first draw})\cdot P(\text{heart on second draw given that we drew a heart on first draw})\cdot P(\text{heart on third draw given that we drew two hearts})=\frac{13}{52}\cdot \frac{12}{51}\cdot \frac{11}{50}=\frac{11}{850}
C(52, 2)
C(20, 2)
C(20, 2) / C(52, 2) = (20 \times 19) / (52 \times 51)
1 / 2
1/2 * 1/2 = 1 / 4
