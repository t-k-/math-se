\ln(x+2)=\ln e^{\ln2} - \ln x
x
\ln ab=\ln a +\ln b
 $$\ln (x+2)x=\ln2.$$ Now take inverse of both sides $$(x+2)x=2.$$ Now you can solve the quadratic equation and select the appropriate 
 value. You get 
 Note that you can not take 
 as 
 is not defined for negative 
. So your answer is 
 which is approximately equal to 
\ln (x+2)+\ln(x)=\ln2.
\ln (x+2)x=\ln2.
(x+2)x=2.
