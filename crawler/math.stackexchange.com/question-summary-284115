 then starts moving again from this reset position with the same distribution, until it hits either 
 again. The barriers are not reset relative to 
 - that is, you will reset back to a distance 
 from the barrier. (I know strictly speaking a Wiener process should start from 0 but ignore this for now.) I essentially want to know what the expected long-term hedging cost is, as a function of the time elapsed 
 and the re-hedge level
