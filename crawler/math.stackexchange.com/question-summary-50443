) be the initial price of the machine and 
 (
) be the interest rate. At the beginning the purchaser has to take  the amount 
 out of his bank account, so after three years the total amount 
 is missing there. On the other hand from the sale of the machine he then can pay back the amount 
. It follows that the total cost per year is $${1\over3}\bigl((1+p)^3-{1\over2}\bigr) P\ ,$$ which amounts to 
 dollars and 
{1\over3}\bigl((1+p)^3-{1\over2}\bigr) P\ ,
19000
P \approx 5630
P \left(\frac{(1.12)^{3}-1}{0.12} \right) = 19000
