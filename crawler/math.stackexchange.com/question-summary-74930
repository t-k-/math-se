6/lamp, and at this price they have been selling 3000 lamps a month. The manufacturer wishes to raise the price and estimated that for each \
\#(\mathrm{lamps\ sold})\cdot(\mathrm{price\ of\ lamps}) - 4\cdot\#(\mathrm{lamps\ sold})
 then her estimation of the number of sold lamps per month is $$ 3000-(p-6)1000=9000-1000p. $$ Hence the monthly profit is $$ (9000-1000p)(p-4)=-1000p^2+13000p-36000. $$ Computing the derivative and setting it to zero shows that the optimal selling point is 
p$ then her estimation of the number of sold lamps per month is 
 Hence the monthly profit is
