50, and fifteen servings of sprouts, which will cost you \
50 for the next five, for a total of \
10 more available, with which you can buy one more serving of spinach. This will happen until you drop to 10 servings of sprouts, at which point you will be able to afford 15 servings of Spinach (the ten from before, plus five more here). So the budget constraint graph is now a line that joins
