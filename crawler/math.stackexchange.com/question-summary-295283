2500, Range of Costs = \
5500. Relationship between Cost and Revenue is given by 
(a)
24
2500
. If you want to calculate the average Revenue, then you can write it in a formula: $$\frac{1}{24}\sum_i R_i$$ so 
 and for the first term you have 
 here you are given what 
 is; that is the mean cost which is 
\
\frac{1}{24}\sum_i R_i

changes
7
\frac{1}{24}\sum_i (d_i-\mu)^2.
\frac{1}{24}\sum_i (7(d_i-\mu))^2=7^2\frac{1}{24}\sum_i (d_i-\mu)^2.
\sqrt{\frac{1}{24}\sum_i (d_i-\mu)^2}=5500\
7^25500^2=(7\times5500)^2
