D = Deviation from optimal 
\bar{c} \space = Mean Tour Cost 
c^* = Optimal Tour Cost 
  D = 100\frac{\bar{c} - c^*}{c^*} 
Fi = Fitness Function 
w_i = weight for X
w_i1 = weight for Y
w_i2 = weight for Z
a_ij = normalised number of cities visited 
a_ij+1 = inverse of normalised Individual cost 
a_ij+2 = inverse of normalised tour cost 
Fi = \sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i a_ij
