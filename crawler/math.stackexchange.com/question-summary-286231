1000=X(1-0.09)^{-3}
X=0.19
1000 now and you want to know the value three years prior, \
 1000(1 - 0.09)^{-3} \approx 1327.01. 
X
1000 in three years. In this case, you would solve $$ 1000 = X(1 - 0.09)^3 $$ and find 
 1000 = X(1 - 0.09)^3 
i
1+i = \frac{1}{1-d}
d
i=\frac{d}{1-d} = \frac{0.09}{0.91} \approx 0.0989
