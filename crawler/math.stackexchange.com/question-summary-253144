100, after 1 year, you will have 12%.  A monthly rate of 1% means after 1 month, you would have 
.  And, in general, after 
 months, you'd have 
.  So, after 12 months, you'd actually have \
r
i/12
1 + r = \left( 1 + \frac{i}{12} \right)^{12}
\frac{i}{12} = (1+r)^{1/12} - 1.
\frac{i}{12} = (1.14)^{1/12} - 1 = 0.010978852.
