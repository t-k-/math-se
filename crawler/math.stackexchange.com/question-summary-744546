\dfrac{1}{e^{i\theta}}={e^{-i\theta}}\text{, i.e., a rotation in the opposite direction.}\\ \dfrac{1}{e^{i\theta}-1}\text{ about the origin is }\left(\sum^\infty_{k=0}e^{i(\theta k+\pi)}\right)\\ \text{This is a sum (as $k$ increases) of rotations by angle $\theta k+\pi$ about the origin.}\\ \text{Of course, there are many other interpretations, and this is mine.}
