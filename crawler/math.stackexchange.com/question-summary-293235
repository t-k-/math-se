 for a single day. However I read that the true possible win is 
566,400

200, 600, 800, 1000

400
6\cdot (200 + 600 + 800 + 1000) + 5\cdot 400= 6\cdot(2600) + 2000 = 17600.

400, 1200, 1600, 2000

800
2 \cdot 6 \cdot (200 + 600 + 800 + 1000) + 4 \cdot 800 = 2 \cdot 15600 + 3200= 34400

 before the second set of double jeopardies. After them, the player will have
