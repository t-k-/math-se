129.00  Using the X/.9 formula, I get \
129.00 as the discount price, the original price would have needed to have been \
0.9
\frac{180}{0.9}=200
180\$$ reduced price is 
0.9
10\%

 reduced price is $200\

\left(\frac{100-d}{100}\right)\cdot p_{orig} = p_{disc}
d=10
\left(\frac{100-10}{100}\right)\cdot p_{orig} = p_{disc}
\Longrightarrow 0.9\cdot p_{orig} = p_{disc}
=\frac{10}{9}\times

0.9\cdot O = N
O = \frac{N}{0.9}
\frac{100-d}{100}\cdot p_{orig} = p_{disc}
p_{orig} = p_{disc} \cdot \frac{100}{100-d}
