\def\i{\pmb i}\def\k{\pmb k}$$$r(t) = x(t)\i + z(t) \k $$ on some 
-intervall 
, then we can apply the given information. Keeping in mind, the construction of sine and cosine, we have that 
 describes a circle of radius 1 around 
, we have a circle of radius 
 around 
, now 
 is a circle of radius 2 around 
, adding 
$r(t) = x(t)\i + z(t) \k 
 r(t) = (3 + 2\cos t)\i + 2\sin t \;\k, \qquad t \in [0,2\pi]
