\
 today will be worth 
 dollars in one year, 
 dollars in two years, and so on.  Thus dividing by 
 
 and so on gives the values today of the future payments.  The question is asking for the constant interest rate 
 for which $$\frac{10}{1+i}+\frac{10}{(1+i)^2}+\frac{10}{(1+i)^3}+\frac{110}{(1+i)^4}=110.7853381,$$ and there are different ways to approximate 
\frac{10}{1+i}+\frac{10}{(1+i)^2}+\frac{10}{(1+i)^3}+\frac{110}{(1+i)^4}=110.7853381,
