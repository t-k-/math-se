1. Once you build a block of a larger size, using one costs only \
5 to build a block of size 5 using five blocks of size 1. Now that you have a block of size 5, you can use them to build even a larger block, say a block of size 10, using two of these for a cost of 2 * 1 = \
7. Build a block of size 5 using five of size-1 blocks for \
2. The total cost will be 7 + 5 + 2 = \
5. Then use two of size 5 blocks to build a block of size 10 for \
9, which is much cheaper than building each with size-1 blocks that would cost 10 + 20 = \
3 and build a block of size 6 with two of these for \
4 and use five of these to build a size-20 block for \
2 and \
