\nor$, we will try to express $\bar{}$ (not), $+$ (or) and $\cdot$ (and) with it. You can use these for your two given formulas. Let's start with not. As $x \nor y$ is $\overline{x+y}$, we can - using that $x+x \equiv x$ - rewrite not as  
 Now for or, we have, as not is idempotent, that  
 As we already know that $\overline{p} \equiv p \nor p$ for a formula $p$, we get  
 To express and, recall that $xy \equiv \overline{\bar x + \bar y}$, so (using again what we know for not)
