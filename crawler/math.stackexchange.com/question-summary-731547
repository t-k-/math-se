200 to set things up. Rent the building, put up a sign at the entrance, etc. Then, after this, you pay \
45 each. You made a profit of \
200 as a set up cost. If you hadn't paid these \
3200. So, let us forget about the setup cost and think that our profit was \
25 to produce each hat, and we sell the hat for \
20 of profit. Our overall profit is \
3200/20 = 160
 P = 45x - (200 + 25x) = 3000 \\ 20x - 200 = 3000
