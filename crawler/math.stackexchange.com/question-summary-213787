 \Pr(\text{more than three throws}) = 1 - \Pr(\text{three or fewer throws}). 
 \begin{align*} & \Pr(\text{3 or fewer throws})\\ = & \Pr(\text{exactly 1 throw}) + \Pr(\text{exactly 2 throws}) + \Pr(\text{exactly 3 throws})\\ = & 0.9^0 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9^1 \cdot 0.1 + 0.9^2 \cdot 0.1\\ = & 0.271. \end{align*} 
 \begin{align*} \Pr(\text{more than three throws}) &= 1 - \Pr(\text{three or fewer throws})\\ &= 1 - 0.271\\ &= 0.729. \end{align*}
