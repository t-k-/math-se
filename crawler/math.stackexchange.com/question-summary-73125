497500 = x + y
x = 2y
497500 = 2y + y
497500 = 3y

162,500. We can now use either equation to find out how much the older son received. I'll use the first one to get $$ 162,500 + Y = 497,500 $$ and so $$ Y = 335,000. $$ So, the older son received \
 Y + (2Y + 10,000) = 497,500, 
 Y = 162,500. 
 162,500 + Y = 497,500 
 Y = 335,000.
