P~(A|B)=\frac{P(A~\text{and}~B)}{P~(B)}.
 \begin{align*}  P~(B)& = P~(99~\text{are not defective}) + P~ (100 ~\text{are not defective})\\ &=100\cdot 0.95^{99}\cdot 0.05 + 0.95^{100}.  \end{align*}
\begin{align*} P~(A~\text{and}~ B) &= P~(\text{one is defective and the first is not defective})\\ & +~ P~(\text{none is defective and the first is not defective})\\ & = 99\cdot 0.95^{99}\cdot 0.05 + 0.95^{100}. \end{align*}
