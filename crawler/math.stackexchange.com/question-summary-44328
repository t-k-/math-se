|w| = 1
arg(w) = \frac{2}{5}\pi
\therefore |w^2| = 1
arg(w^2) = \frac{2}{5}\pi + \frac{2}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi
|w^3| = 1
arg(w^3) = \frac{2}{5}\pi + \frac{2}{5}\pi + \frac{2}{5}\pi = \frac{6}{5}\pi
\therefore w^2 = cos{\frac{4}{5}\pi} + isin{\frac{4}{5}\pi}, w^3 = cos{\frac{6}{5}\pi} + isin{\frac{6}{5}\pi}, w^* = cos{\frac{2}{5}\pi} - isin{\frac{2}{5}\pi}
