153.75
1.23x = 153.75
153.75 - 0.23 \cdot 153.75 = x
\
 (to make it easy), and the tax is 10% (again easy numbers), then the total price is 
110
\
 from the total, getting an 'original' price of only 
99
x
price + tax* price
price*(1+tax)
\frac{1}{(1+tax)} \neq(1-tax)
taxedprice = price + tax*price
price = taxedprice - tax*taxedprice 
taxedprice 
price = (price + tax*price)- tax*(price + tax*price)
price = price + tax*price- tax*price -tax*tax*price
0 = -tax*tax*price
