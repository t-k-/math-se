{\text{My solution: }}
Tn<0.001
ar^{n-1}<0.001
(18)(0.55)^{n-1}<0.001
(0.55)^{n-1}<\frac{1}{18000}
(n-l){\log 0.55}<{\log \frac{1}{18000}}
n-1<16.389
n<16.389+1
n<17.389
n=17
{\text{However, the answer given for this question is}}
n=18
{\text{Would anyone tell me either it is my answer  or the answer given that is wrong ,please?}}
{\text{Thank you.}}
\log(0.55) < 0
(n-1) \, \log(0.55) \lt \log \frac{1}{18000}
n-1 \gt 16.389\ldots
18 \times 0.55^{17-1} = 0.001262\ldots
18 \times 0.55^{18-1} = 0.000694\ldots
