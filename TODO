! fan less than, then sub tree is possible.

! mark and cross only happens when more than one brwords are found for a query brword.

! ID belongs to level x, ordered by ID, : 
1) score pruning: Score can be given to specific ID whenever all the relevant brword of that ID is fully get.
2) using sum of best match brw score will help to prune doc with bad score.
3) prun trees with different pin array.

NTCIR data evalutation

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
concurrent retrieval

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Provide a WEB interface like Symbol Lab

incorporation with general text search

Context search, search for web pages containing the most selected keywords (not only restricted to formula):
given keywords K1 AND K2 AND K3, with weights a1 a2 a3.
Do three times of separate search on each keywords, list results in three thread ordered by pageID:
thread1: 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 7 9
thread2: 1 2 3 4 8 9
thread3: 1 2 2 2 6 7 8
Then you get, for example, page with ID = 1 has a vector(2,1,1) and page with ID = 2 has a vector(0,1,3).
The final score of a page is given by, for example of page with ID=1: (2,1,1) * (a1,a2,a3)

NOT operation

provide instances for elastic search

\def\specialFrac#1#2{\frac{x + #1}{y + #2}} 整个网页有效，所以要用预处理
\DeclareMathOperator
\newcommand
\newenvironment

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
container:
	* callbk -> for loop
	* pa_extra -> variable arguments
