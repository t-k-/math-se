incorporation with general text search

Context search, search for web pages containing the most selected keywords (not only restricted to formula):
given keywords K1 AND K2 AND K3, with weights a1 a2 a3.
Do three times of separate search on each keywords, list results in three thread ordered by pageID:
thread1: 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 7 9
thread2: 1 2 3 4 8 9
thread3: 1 2 2 2 6 7 8
Then you get, for example, page with ID = 1 has a vector(2,1,1) and page with ID = 2 has a vector(0,1,3).
The final score of a page is given by, for example of page with ID=1: (2,1,1) * (a1,a2,a3)

NOT operation

provide instances for elastic search

==========
Family characteristic member indexing:

/link path rm common path near root
does not go beyond when search in /link dir
longest path search first
set two limits: 1. searched items max number; 2. search items for every a|b (posting file should have a limited size)
choose(n,2) instead of indexing both a|b and b|a. (choose by path length: a|b should also be a*|b)
