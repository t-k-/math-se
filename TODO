* build library path config 

* sep_class should have commutative property.

identify hotspot (long posting list) in filesystem

brword dir depth information (do not calculate on runing time) to search in the order of depth

brword ID does not need a long HASH

multiple brword key for one formula key.

if paths are diff, brw id must be diff

given b1|b2, b1* and b2* should satisfy: root_depth(b1*) - root_depth(b1) = root_depth(b2*) - root_depth(b2)

incorporation with general text search

Context search, search for web pages containing the most selected keywords (not only restricted to formula):
given keywords K1 AND K2 AND K3, with weights a1 a2 a3.
Do three times of separate search on each keywords, list results in three thread ordered by pageID:
thread1: 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 7 9
thread2: 1 2 3 4 8 9
thread3: 1 2 2 2 6 7 8
Then you get, for example, page with ID = 1 has a vector(2,1,1) and page with ID = 2 has a vector(0,1,3).
The final score of a page is given by, for example of page with ID=1: (2,1,1) * (a1,a2,a3)

NOT operation
